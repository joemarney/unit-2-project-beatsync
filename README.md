# Project 2: Beatsync

![beatsync logo on a black loading screen with slogan "have your say" underneath](/assets/app-screenshots/loading-screen-real.png)

## The Idea

The app is designed to give the user an idea of the venue before they go. I have been to many events where I was disappointed with certain aspects which made the event less fun overall. If I knew about them before I got there I could better prepare or not go at all!

## Accessing the code

To check out my code you can go to my [Github repo][git]

## Planning

As with the first project, I created my wire frame design with Figma. I did not learn from last time and again designed something a bit too ambitiously.

## Coding Process

## Challenges

virtuals with foreign and local fields
.populate()
creating a seed for db - having to change half my code where pictures should have been uploaded

## Wins

forEach inside forEach to iterate on profile page
showing favourites on profile screen
and feedback given only if ID's match up

## Bugs

only seem to be able to upload certain pictures and i am not sure whether it is to do with size or something else.
